For example, http://m8y.org/tmp/testcase272.xhtml\n\nNow I ran into another issue, this time in Firefox.  URL below demos.\nhttp://m8y.org/tmp/testcase374.xhtml\n\nEssentially though, and unlike Chrome on my Nexus 5, Firefox resizes the viewport when the soft keyboard appears.\n\nThis causes an annoying flickering of on-screen viewport sized elements as the keyboard appears, and while the keyboard is active, everything sized in vh is about half normal size.\n\nIt\'d be nice if Firefox didn\'t do that.  snorp says it is to ensure the edited element is visible. Seems to me you could position it on the page so it\'d be at the top of the viewport.  Even if the element is last on the page, seems you could probably kinda scroll past the end.\n\nBTW, Chrome on the Nexus 5 has an irritating bug in this demo where it \"loses track\" of the size of the elements.  So the text area suddenly jumps down to half its former size, or one or more of the labels.   There appears to be no consistency, but seems to happen at random when I\'m unfocusing on the text area and when trying to \"toggle\" the labels.\n\nOh well. Mobile is fraught w/ stuff like this, and Chrome does this kinda thing to me all the time.  Witness how they broke positioning for their convenience and without even a -webkit-position prefix..\n _summary_start_ Using keyboard on inputs causes viewport to resize, shrinking elements based on viewport units.  _summary_end_'

Load the file \"ffTestLonga.html\"\n2. Load the file \"ffTestLongb.html\" - do not navigate backwards or forwards in history; just paste or manually enter the URL for this file and hit \"Go\"\n3. Load the file \"ffTestLongc.html\" - do not navigate backwards or forwards in history; just paste or manually enter the URL for this file and hit \"Go\"\n4. Load the file \"ffTestLongd.html\" - do not navigate backwards or forwards in history; just paste or manually enter the URL for this file and hit \"Go\"\n5. Continually hit the back button to navigate backwards through the history until you arrive back at the file \"ffTestLonga.html\"\n\n\nActual results:\n\nIn step 5, an unexpected scroll occurs when re-displaying the \"ffTestLongb.html\" and \"ffTestLonga.html\" files.  \n\nAlthough not measured with these files, window.pageYOffset executed with other files showed a scroll position of 529px with the S4 and S5 (in portrait orientation).  A scroll position of 530px was shown with the S3 (in portrait orientation).  Smaller scroll positions were shown with all devices in landscape orientation.  That said, based on visual inspection only, the attached files seem to produce similar results.\n\nFWIW, in an effort to determine the scroll position with the other files, I noticed that a scroll position of 0px was shown with $(document).ready and $(window).load.  The displayed scroll position (e.g., of 529px and 530px) was only shown using a setTimeout within a $(window).load.\n\n\nExpected results:\n\nThere should be no scrolling when re-displaying the \"ffTestLongb.html\" and \"ffTestLonga.html\" files in step 5.  Repeating steps 1 through 5 with the corresponding shorter files (e.g., \"ffTestShorta.html,\" \"ffTestShortb.html,\" \"ffTestShortc.html,\" and \"ffTestShortd.html\") shows no scroll as expected.

If you refresh the page, the credentials will be typed in.\n\nWhat should happen: The credentials should be autofilled after master password has been typed even if the browser has just started up.\n\nNotes:\n* This only seems to happen if you reach the login form immediately after startup (haven\'t measure the exact time but maybe during the first 10 seconds or so). Waiting for a few seconds before navigating to the site works fine.\n* I toggled the signons.debug pref and took a look at the console output of login manager. Here\'s the output for the failure case (removed the original domain; I\'ve seen this happen for many different sites):\n\n> LoginManagerContent:onDOMFormHasPassword: <form method=\"post\" action=\"/login\" id=\"login\"> Object { action: \"https://example.com\", elements: Array[4], rootElement: <form#login>, autocomplete: \"on\", ownerDocument: HTMLDocument → Kerberos, 1 more… } LoginManagerContent.jsm:281\n> nsLoginManager:No alternate nsILoginManagerStorage registered nsLoginManager.js:6\n> Login storage:Opening database at /data/data/org.mozilla.firefox/files/mozilla/wqn2dgzz.default/signons.sqlite storage-mozStorage.js:13\n> Login storage:Initializing Database storage-mozStorage.js:74\n> nsLoginManager:Searching for logins matching host: \"https://example.com\" formSubmitURL:  httpRealm:  nsLoginManager.js:19\n> Login storage:Creating new statement for query: SELECT * FROM moz_logins WHERE (hostname = :hostname) storage-mozStorage.js:71\n> Login storage:_searchLogins: returning 1 logins storage-mozStorage.js:38\n> Login crypto:SDR slot status is 3 crypto-SDR.js:11\n> Login crypto:SDR slot status is 4 crypto-SDR.js:11\n> Login crypto:Prompted for a master password, notifying for passwordmgr-crypto-login crypto-SDR.js:13\n> Login crypto:SDR slot status is 4 crypto-SDR.js:11\n> Login storage:_findLogins: returning 1 logins storage-mozStorage.js:48\n\nHowever, if I wait a while before going to the site, the output looks completely different and the autofill works (not pasting it inline since it\'s quite long; see attached success-log.txt). This suggests there\'s some deferred initialization going on and if you\'re too fast, some pieces are not in place when the autocomplete is requested.\n\nI\'ve hit this in older Firefox for Android versions but haven\'t tested any pre-release versions (current release, Fx45 is the latest I\'ve tested this bug)..\n _summary_start_ Login credentials are not autofilled if a login form is encountered too soon after startup  _summary_end_'

If it\'s a sum of the other two counts, how does this affect Sync, if at all?.\n _summary_start_ Consider dropping History.VISITS aggregate count  _summary_end_'
1277330,0,'If history is imported multiple times from the Android Browser, we\'ll see that History.VISITS count keeps going up. That is because we unconditionally increase it by number of visits in the Android Browser history, regardless of the fact that we might already have these visits in the Visits table, and import might not have actually done anything.\n\nOnce Bug 1274029 lands, this bug will also affect History.LOCAL_VISITS aggregate as well, in the same way.\n\nNote that Visits table behaves correctly, in that no duplicates are inserted.\n\nImpact: if user imports their history multiple times, counts will keep going up - especially local_visits aggregate (past Bug 1274029), and their top sites will start bubbling up imported items.\n\nApproach #1: ideally, we want to look at how many visits we actually inserted into the visits table, and increase our counters by that number. Due to how import is done (via batch operations that get built up and then flushed), we\'ll first need to refactor import in order to obtain \"number of visits inserted\". There isn\'t too much to refactor, but this code isn\'t covered by unit tests...\n\nApproach #2: remember when was the last time we imported, and only insert/update counts if Android Browser has items which are newer. This could be pretty brittle, since our wall time might (read: will) change.\n\nApproach #3: recalculate our visit counts based on the visit table after we import. This will ensure that History.LOCAL_VISITS aggregate is correct (since we can treat visits table as the source of truth) and ensure that top sites list is unaffected, but might be problematic for History.VISITS.\n\nApproach #4: ignore this problem and mark it as a \"known issue\"; Android Browser is dead anyway past API21, and import is disabled on newer devices.\n\nI\'m personally leaning towards #3 + rethink the need for History.VISITS that we keep up manually - could it be just a sum of LOCAL_VISITS+REMOTE_VISITS which is calculated in the Combined view? Do we need it at all, now that it\'s not used for Top Sites? See Bug 1277329..\n _summary_start_ Importing Android Browser history multiple times keeps increasing visit counts  _summary_end_'

It looks like when mobile/base/gfx/GeckoSoftwareLayerClient.java was deprecated in favor of mobile/base/gfx/GeckoLayerClient.java the endDrawing stuff was carried over, and then later removed from there when the endDrawing method was removed from that file.\n\nAfter looking around the code a little, I found what appears to be a possible place to put this back into the code, so I have a patch to attach.

776030,0,'Fennec\'s PanZoomController was forked into AsyncPanZoomController for B2G work. Eventually we should reconcile the two and merge them into a unified pan/zoom controller. This bug is to track the work that needs to be done for that.\n\nA general outline of the work that needs to be done is:\n- Extract an interface from the java PanZoomController\n- Implement a \"native\" version of the interface that delegates calls to an instance of AsyncPanZoomController stored in nsWindow\n- Eventually move the TouchEventHandler code into c++ as well. Currently some of this is merged into the C++ AsyncPanZoomController but it should probably be broken out into a separate class\n\nAlso fennec\'s PanZoomController deals with viewport information mostly in device pixels, but the AsyncPanZoomController uses CSS pixels. Going forward it\'s probably best to stick to CSS pixels (although this may change depending on discussions with layout/gfx people) so switching java over to use CSS pixels might be a good idea as a first step..\n _summary_start_ (apz-fennec) \n      Allow Fennec to use the AsyncPanZoomController  _summary_end_'
